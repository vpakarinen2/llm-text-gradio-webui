Title: Personal Finance Basics

Personal finance is about managing your money so you can meet your goals and reduce stress.

Key areas:
- Budgeting: track income and expenses, and give every euro a job.
- Emergency fund: save 3–6 months of essential expenses in a liquid account.
- Debt management: pay high-interest debt first, such as credit cards.
- Saving and investing: use tax-advantaged accounts when available.

Simple budgeting steps:
1. List all sources of income.
2. List fixed expenses (rent, utilities, insurance) and variable ones (food, entertainment).
3. Assign spending limits and track them monthly.

Basic investing ideas:
- Diversify using broad index funds instead of individual stock picking.
- Focus on long-term horizons rather than short-term market movements.
- Keep fees low, as costs compound over time.

Good habits, like paying yourself first and reviewing your budget monthly, are more important than complex strategies.
