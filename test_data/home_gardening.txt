Title: Home Gardening Basics

Home gardening is a practical way to grow fresh vegetables and herbs.
Most plants need at least 6 hours of direct sunlight and well-drained soil.

Key tips:
- Start with easy crops: lettuce, radishes, cherry tomatoes, and basil.
- Water deeply but less frequently, aiming for moist, not soggy, soil.
- Add compost each season to maintain soil fertility.
- Rotate plant families to reduce disease and pest buildup.

Container gardening:
- Use pots with drainage holes.
- Choose a high-quality potting mix rather than garden soil.
- Herbs like mint, thyme, and rosemary grow well in containers.
