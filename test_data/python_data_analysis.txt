Title: Getting Started with Python Data Analysis

Python is a versatile language widely used for data analysis.
The core ecosystem includes NumPy for numerical arrays, Pandas for tabular data,
and Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualization.

A typical workflow:
1. Load data from CSV using pandas.read_csv.
2. Clean missing values with dropna or fillna.
3. Aggregate with groupby to compute statistics.
4. Visualize results with histograms or line charts.

Example:
- Use DataFrame.describe() to quickly inspect distributions.
- Use df.groupby("country")["sales"].sum() to aggregate sales by country.

For larger-than-memory datasets, tools like Dask or Polars can be helpful.
