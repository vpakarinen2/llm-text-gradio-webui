Title: Windows Tools and Backup Strategy

On Windows, keeping reliable backups is crucial before major changes.

Tools:
- Rufus: creates bootable USB drives for installing operating systems.
- Windows Backup and Restore: built-in backup utility for system images.
- PowerShell: advanced scripting and automation tool.

Recommended backup steps:
1. Use Rufus to create a bootable USB installer before reinstalling Windows.
2. Create a system image on an external drive.
3. Export important files from Desktop, Documents, and Downloads.
4. Test the bootable USB on your machine to ensure it works.

Always verify backups before formatting any drive.
