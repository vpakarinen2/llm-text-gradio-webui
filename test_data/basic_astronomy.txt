Title: Introduction to Basic Astronomy

Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects such as planets, stars, galaxies, and nebulae.

Key concepts:
- Solar system: the Sun, eight major planets, their moons, and smaller bodies like asteroids.
- Stars: massive spheres of hot gas that produce light through nuclear fusion.
- Galaxies: huge collections of stars, gas, and dark matter bound together by gravity.
- Light-year: the distance light travels in one year, used to measure cosmic distances.

Observing the sky:
- Use a simple star chart or app to identify constellations.
- Dark, rural locations with little light pollution provide better views.
- Binoculars are often enough to see star clusters and some nebulae.

Common objects to look for:
- The Moon: craters, maria (dark plains), and phases.
- Planets like Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
- The Milky Way band on clear, dark nights.

Astronomy connects physics, chemistry, and mathematics to help us understand the universe and our place in it.
